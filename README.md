# Instrument_One
A guitar-inspired accessible musical instrument

Instrument One was designed in collaboration with physically disabled musician Eoin Fitzpatrick, his father Peter and the Drake Music Project Northern Ireland. It is a novel, guitar-inspired accessible instrument that recreates the experience of selecting chords on a fretboard and strumming guitar strings. It is a novel instrument, tailored towards Eoin's unique requirements.
